# MySocialNetwork
A basic social network in Symfony 2, mainly for the purpose of learning the different components of Symfony 2

This is an ongoing project of a social network, made in Symfony 2.

There is currently no real visual front for the project.

The main purpose of this project is to allow me to be more familiar with the framework Symfony 2.

The current features available are :

- Registration system with database saving

- Secured log in as admin or user

- A basic user search with firstname or lastname

Currently working on : 

- A system that allows the user to add another user as friend system

- A system that allows the user to have his own page with photos and messages
